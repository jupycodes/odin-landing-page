CSS Assignment - Create a landing page

From "The Odin Project" foundations course, the task was to create a basic landing page for a website using only HTML and CSS. In this project, I learnt how to apply flexbox and CSS grids as an introduction to responsive design. It was definitely a challenge doing thi without the help of any frameworks and I was really happy later on when I learnt how to use Bootstrap!
